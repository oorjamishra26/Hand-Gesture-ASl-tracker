I have created two models:
1 - Video Gesture Dectection
2 - Hand Tracker in Realtime to create data for training image models

#Video Gesture Dectection#

The code implements a video gesture detection system. It processes input video data, applies background subtraction using the MOG2 model, detects gestures using contour analysis, overlays "DETECTED" text on identified gestures, and generates an output video with annotated frames. The system is designed to identify gestures by detecting moving objects in the video frames and annotating them for visual indication.
